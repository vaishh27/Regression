# Regression
What is Regression?
•Regression is the problem of predicting a continuous quantity output for an input.
In Regression, no classified labels (such as good or bad, spam or not spam, …) are predicted. Instead, regression outputs continuous, often unbound, numbers. This makes it useful for financial predictions and alike.
